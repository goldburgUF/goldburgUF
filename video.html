                <p>For this project, I created an artistic digital production using iMovie. I find that "Khan-style" videos work best when discussing math topics. With the use of some production techniques, I was able to clarify the mathematical processes in the video. I decided to make a video about the origins of Probability Theory based on the letters written by Fermat and Pascal in the 1650s.
<br><br>
For the video, I started with writing a script. I kept the pace intentionally quick, and used Audacity to edit out my breaths and any mistakes to make the audio sound better and limit the pauses. From there, I dropped the audio into iMovie and began to add the images and text to match up with the narration. I had to use Photoshop to create the scoreboard image and also to create the image that represented the winning possibilities towards the end of the video. Once I had the images matched up nicely with the narration, I added "cross-blur" transitions between the images and reduced the times of those transitions from 1 s to 0.5 s since the images weren't displayed for very long as is. I utilized the Ken Burns effect to zoom in on key parts of the images like the 6 on the dice when I talked about rolling a 6. Next, I added the necessary captions, title and credits. Lastly, I found background audio that would add to the video without being distracting (lowered its volume level throughout the video) and then faded it out at the end.</p>
