				<h2>Book Cover</h2>

I used Adobe Photoshop to create my book cover for “Norfolk’s Academy - The Heart of Tidewater Volume 2 - The 21st Century.” I take photos for my school and wanted to find a way to incorporate some of those photos. A retired history teacher is currently working on a sequel to his first book about the history of the school, so I decided to make a cover for this future volume. I started with the background image (of the new entrance to the school) which was shot in landscape, so I had to crop it to portrait mode to fit the book. The image was overpowering, so I used the “blending options” to make the image more opaque. I then found images of the two most recent Head of School from this century. The image on the left was a very old portrait that had been digitized and was probably taken in the 1980s or 1990s. The one on the right was taken in the last few years. I used the “Quick Selection Tool” to select the figures and remove the backgrounds from the portraits, and also had to use the “negative” function to deselect because the quick select didn’t work great, especially on the older image. I also had to use the lasso tool on several sections to make their figures crisp and remove small bits of background that were missed by the quick select. Additionally, the image on the right was over-exposed and did not look good next to the older portrait, so I adjusted the brightness, contrast and levels so that the exposure and images of the people looked similar. Lastly I used the eye-dropper tool to extract the exact color from the school’s logo for the color of the title and then used the school’s official font for the text of the title.
				
				<h2>Logo</h2>

For the logo, I used my business Goldburg Photography. I love sports photography the most, and recently I have been the team photographer for the lacrosse teams at a local d3 university. I wanted to incorporate that element into the logo. I used Adobe Illustrator to create the logo. 
<br><br>
I started with the text “Goldburg Photography” and wanted to find a way to incorporate the photography aspect and lacrosse aspect into the logo. Since both words are pretty long, I decided to put them on separate lines. I had a couple ideas for making the first P in photography look like either a camera or lens, but landed on having the top part be the camera. The lowercase p in photography reminded me a lot of an old-school wooden lacrosse stick, so I decided to include that element to incorporate the lacrosse into the logo. I like simplicity in general so I decided to keep the logo black and white. 
<br><br>
I started with the text and chose a simple font from google fonts called Roboto and then changed some font sizes. I made the first P in photography a little larger because it needed to be so you could see the camera and the rest of the word photography a little smaller. I then “created outlines” by right clicking on the text so that the letters were individually editable. Deleting the second P where the lacrosse stick is was a simple click and delete. It was more challenging using the erase tool to erase the top right part of the P, but I was eventually able to get the straight edge.
<br><br>
When creating the camera, I used rectangles and circles using the shape tools. I had to change the fill and stroke several times depending on which part of the camera I was drawing. Holding the “shift” key while drawing the circles kept them perfectly circular. Additionally, I didn’t want hard edges on the outline of the shape, so clicking the buttons to change the radius of the corners made them curved. The lacrosse stick was much more challenging to draw. I used a combination of the pen tool and curvature tool to draw the initial shape of the stick. I created the anchor points and then clicked and dragged to get the curvature I wanted. I added another curve using this tool for the white line at the top of the stick. Lastly, I used the paintbrush tool to create the strings in the middle of the stick to give the intertwined look.
