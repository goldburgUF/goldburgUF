                <p>As a computer science teacher, I decided to do an animation that describes one of the more basic control structures in program, an if-then statement. This was definitely the most challenging assignment for me so far, since a lot of the commands in Animate did not seem as intuitive as some of the other projects/applications we used. I started by drawing a computer and hands in Illustrator to get my vector images and imported them into Animate. I locked the computer in place and then used the classic tween to move the hands around to simulate typing on the computer. I locked those in and moved on to the actual "scientific" explanation.
		<br>
I decided it would be easier to record my audio first so I didn't have to rush through any statements when describing the control flow and then animate based on that timing. I started by drawing the simple control structure on the right, using shapes and text in animate. I then animated each of the boxes to grow and shrink based on which part of the structure was being utilized. I displayed the True and False and had them grow on the screen after converting the text to symbols so I could use the tween to make them grow. Lastly, I had the arrows expand to show the control of flow as well.
